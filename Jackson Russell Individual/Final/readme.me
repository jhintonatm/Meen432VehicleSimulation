In my individual run, the controller handled the added slopes on the straightaways without any major issues, and the car still made it through all 17 laps without going off the track. The hills did make the system work a little harder, though, and that showed up in the final SOC. I ended at 74.10%, which is a bit lower than the group result of 74.95%. Overall, the controller stayed stable for the full hour, but the elevation changes definitely cost a little extra energy.
