During my individual run, the controller handled the added slopes on the straightaways without any major issues, and the car successfully completed all 17 laps without going off the track. The hills did make the system work a little harder, though, and that showed up in the final SOC. I ended at 74.10%, which is a bit lower than the group result of 74.95%. Overall, the controller stayed stable for the full hour, but the elevation changes definitely cost a little extra energy. SOC indiv.png shows the SOC of the run. Race Stat.png displays the outputted race statistics. speed vs time.png Shows the desired Speed vs actual Speed over time. Open MEEN_432_proj4_Russell_indiv.slx then run Project4init.m, then gentrack.m, then animate.m.
