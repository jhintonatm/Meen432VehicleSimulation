There were a few significant changes to the code after our week 2 checkpoint. The lateral car dynamics and frame conversion subfunctions were kept the same throughout. Changes were made to the driver model, adding in both a PID controller for the steering angle and the speed of the car. Adding this PID controller has allowed our car to stay on track at lower speeds. A problem that we are still running into is a gradual veering off the track at higher speeds. This gradual misalignment doesnâ€™t impact the first lap; however, with a 1000-second simulation time, the small misalignment becomes dramatic enough to leave the track boundary. The PID controller implemented allowed the car to stay on the track for the full 1000 seconds while going 13 m/s. Additionally, our car in the week 2 checkpoint remained fixed while moving through the track, and we were able to implement code that rotates the car in accordance with the turns being taken. To run our code, first open Project_2_kinematic_model.slx Simulink model, then run init.m, then gentrack.m, then, then finally run animate.m. What is going to be output will be the generated track and the car going around the track. After the simulation is complete, the race statistics will print in the command window, displaying the Total Distance Traveled, Total Time, Average speed, the times each loop is completed, and whether the car left or stayed on the track.
