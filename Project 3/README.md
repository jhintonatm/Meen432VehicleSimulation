For this project, we developed a Simulink model designed to match a desired emissions-testing speed profile while adhering to the realistic physical constraints of a vehicle. We used an updated initialization file similar to Project 2, with the addition of drag-related constants, motor characteristics, and battery behavior. Our Simulink model is organized into several main subfunctions: Driver Control, Motor, Power Train, Wheel Mechanics, Braking, and Vehicle. We tested the model using two separate EPA time-versus-speed files. After simulation, the difference between the desired and actual vehicle velocities remained within 3 m/s throughout both tests, demonstrating good model accuracy. After adding and obsrving a scope block for the integrated motor power value, we observed a 6.21 MJ consumption for our model with the EPA highway desired speed profile, and a 6.20 MJ energy consumption for the EPA urban desired speed profile. The velocity scope outputs have been saved as PNG files and included in this folder in case the Simulink model does not run properly. To run the simulations, first download the files p3_init.m, Project_3_Kinematic_Model.slx, and EPA_urban.mat, ensuring that EPA_urban.mat is in the same directory as the other files. Then open Project_3_Kinematic_Model.slx in Simulink and run init.m in MATLAB to initialize parameters. In the Drive Schedule subfunction, open the Signal Editor block and confirm that the scenario file name is set to EPA_urban.mat. Run the model and observe the Velocity Scope, which displays both the desired and actual velocity curves. To switch to the second simulation, open the Drive Schedule subfunction again, click on the Signal Editor block, and select the other scenario from the Active Scenario drop-down menu. Finally, run the model again to generate the new simulation results, which will automatically appear on the Velocity Scope.
