For the second week progress check of the second project, we have added lateral dynamics to our model. To accomplish this, we created three subfunctions that calculate the slip condition, tire force calculations, and lateral dynamics calculations. The tire slip for the front and rear tires is calculated using the velocity in the x and y directions, the prescribed steering angle, and the rotational speed. The tire forces are then calculated using the tire slip angles and provided coefficients. The lateral dynamics calculate the acceleration in the y direction and yaw rate from the forces on the front and rear tires, and the velocity in the y direction. Additionally, we adjusted our driver model to use a steering angle that accounts for lateral forces through the turns. We struggled with accessing the carData dictionaryâ€™s contents for calculations in our Simulink functions. After testing at speeds ranging from 15 to 50 m/s, we arrived at the conclusion that with our current model, it only safely completes the track in 204 seconds at 15 m/s. Going into week 3, we need to correct our driver model to anticipate the turn instead of the reactionary error correction method we are using. To run our code, first run init.m, then gentrack.m, then open Project_2_kinematic_model.slx Simulink model, then finally run animate.m. What is going to be output will be the generated track and driver going around the track at full speed.
