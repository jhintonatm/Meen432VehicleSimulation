First run gentrack.m, then init.m, then Project_2_kinematic_model.slx Simulink model, then finally run animate.m 
We used the provided files as a starting template for our code, then created a customized driver function to correct the steering delta to the track. Using known track positions and State variables, the function assesses where on the track the car should be, then uses the steering angle to guide the car on track. We separated these proportional controls between staying on the straight lines and the curves, depending on position in the track. With the radial nudge a diffrence between desired radial distance to the cars actual radial distance through the curves.
