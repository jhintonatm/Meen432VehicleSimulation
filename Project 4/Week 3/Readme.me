Our controller is a feed-forward PID setup, where the feed-forward term handles most of the cornering and the PID loop cleans up the remaining heading error. With the speeds we tuned for, it worked well—smooth through the corners and able to stay on the track without a fight. When we tried pushing the car faster, though, it started drifting wide because the steering corrections just couldn’t keep up at those higher speeds. It’s clear the controller works within a certain range, but we’d need more tuning or a different approach to reliably handle anything faster.
Run the Simulink file MEEN_432_proj4part2.slx, then project4init.m, gentrack.m, then animate.m.
